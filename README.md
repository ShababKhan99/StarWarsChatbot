## #Star Wars Chatbot

This program is an AI Chatbot which utilizes the OpenAI API to allow you to speak with you favorite Star Wars characters. By using prompt engineering and the OpenAI API, I was able to create an API which can respond to you as one of five characters: Darth Maul, Obi Wan Kenobi, Master Yoda, Anakin Skywalker, and Boba Fett.

To use this program, you will have to have an OpenAI API key, and the key must by saved as an environment variable under the title:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY
```

I used this program as a way to experiment with the OpenAI API, which has caught my eye for some time. It also allowed me to learn about GUI implementation using tkinter and customtkinter on Python. I hope to make the GUI itself better by using more of the customtkinter functionality overtime.

You will have to install both the OpenAI and CustomTkinter python modules using pip. This can be done by running these lines in your CLI of choice, once you've ensured python and pip are installed correctly.

```
python3 -m pip install openai
python3 -m pip install customtkinter
```
